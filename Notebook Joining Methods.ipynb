    "Answer:\n",
    "In addition to the shear stress, the edges of the join will experience peel stresses. A joint with an eccentricity (like a lap joint) experiences \"secondary bending\" under a tensile load. This bending is quantified by measuring the \"out-of-plane displacements of the neutral line of the joint\". This bending of the neutral axis induces stresses normal to the substrate surface that have a peel action. Similarly to the shear stress, the peel stresses are especially large at the edges of the joint. The maximum load that an adhesively bonded lap joint can have is therefore limited by the peel stress experienced which needs to be lower than the maximum allowable.\n",
