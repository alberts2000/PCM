    "In the figure above the stress distribution for a constant length joint is shown with various thicknesses of the bottom plate. It can be seen that as the asymmetry of the joint increases (the thicknesses of the plates becomes more different) the stress distribution becomes more asymmetric. This is because the thinner plate is less stiff and allows for more strain difference between the plates on the right side thus creating larger shear stress in the adhesive. On the left side of the joint the opposite effect takes place - top plate is highly stressed and more stiff but bottom plates is less stiff while experiencing low stress. Thus, the stress and stiffness differences between the two plates partially cancel out and reduce the shear stress in the adhesive. Both of reduced stress on the left side of the joint and increased stress on the right side of the joint can be seen in the figure generated using Klein model."

    "Answer:\n",
    "In addition to the shear stress, the edges of the join will experience peel stresses. A joint with an eccentricity (like a lap joint) experiences \"secondary bending\" under a tensile load. This bending is quantified by measuring the \"out-of-plane displacements of the neutral line of the joint\". This bending of the neutral axis induces stresses normal to the substrate surface that have a peel action. Similarly to the shear stress, the peel stresses are especially large at the edges of the joint. The maximum load that an adhesively bonded lap joint can have is therefore limited by the peel stress experienced which needs to be lower than the maximum allowable. Sometimes, peel stressed can be higher than the maximum allowable peel stress even when the shear stresses are below the maximum allowable shear stress.\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a lap joint and a scarf joint is the shear stress distribution (in the adhesive) over the length of the overlap. While the adhesive in a lap joint experiences a bathtub distribution, in an ideal scarf joint, the stress is constant along the entire length. Therefore, while the adhesive in a lap joint will have high peaks at the edges that rapidly lower into a relatively low value, the scarf joint will have the adhesive carrying the load homogeneously. This aspect of the scarf joint results is a lower maximum shear stress (for the same load and surface area). A lower maximum shear stress experienced results in a larger maximum carrying load, using the same material.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both lap and scarf joints, the load is gradually transferred by the adhesive over the overlap length by an adherent to the other. The lack of the \"bathtub\" effect in a scarf joint is due to the fact that the cross-section of the adherents changes gradually over the overlap. The gradual change in thickness implies a change in stiffness of the adherent. The gradual change in thickness is matched by the gradual introduction of the load such that the deformation of an adherent's section with a lower thickness and a lower experienced stress matches the deformation of the other adherent's section with a larger thickness and a larger load. A step joint has characteristics of both a step and a scarf joint as it is intrinsically a sequence of smaller steps arranged with the geometry of a scarf joint section (alternatively could be called a discretised scarf joint). Depending on the number of steps and the length of the overlap, the deformation of the adherents may match more closely that of a lap joint or a scarf joint. For each of the constant-thickness sections, the stresses peak at the edges. The larger peaks stay at the absolute edges of the overlap and are larger than those of a scarf joint since the change in thickness is not gradually matching the shear stress transfer but are smaller than the peaks of a lap joint as the difference in deformation of the adherents is smaller. Coinciding with the thickness drops, a rapid change in the shear stress is experienced as the surfaces are perpendicular to the load direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a further remarkable advantage that scarf and step joints have over lap joint, it is the lack of secondary bending.This also contributes in raising the maximum carrying load.\n",

    "We used the Klein model as stated in the BrightSpace announcement. It is assumed that the joint is flush, and the convention is that the left panel is the 'top' panel. Since this model is valid only for the situation depicted in question 1.1, we must make some crude assumptions on the load transfer. The first of these is that an equal load is transferred over all steps. The second is that the adherents in every step strain as if only the load transferred over the step is applied, neglecting any bypass loads to subsequent steps. This is obviously inaccurate since a significant bypass load is present for many of the steps, altering the strain distributions of the adherents and consequently the shear strain in the adhesive.\n",
